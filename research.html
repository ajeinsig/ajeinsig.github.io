											<h3>Emission-Line Diagnostics</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram was created in 1981 as a diagnostic tool to separate strongly star-forming galaxies from Seyfert galaxies. This occurs due to the emission-line strengths produced by different mechanisms powering their emission. </p>
										<p>However, there are some objects that are ambiguous in nature, located between the Kauffmann (Kauffmann et. al., 2001) and Kewley (Kewley et. al. 2003) lines on the BPT diagram. These lines represent an empirical separation of AGN and star-forming galaxies, and the maximum possible starburst emission a galaxy can have, respectively. Between these two lines is the 'Composite Zone.' Galaxies located here are widely considered to contain both AGN and star-formation activity. Composite objects present interesting case studies for the assumed SMBH-host galaxy connection. </p> 
										<p>My work focuses on these objects and, using different emission lines and features in their spectra, attempts to classify the sources of their emission. In addition to learning more about composite objects, ongoing work has found that interesting, often extreme examples of AGN and SF galaxies (radiatively ‘shocked’ SF galaxies, low metallicity AGN) can be found in the 'composite zone.' As we study more objects between the Ka and Ke lines and evaluate the sources of their emission, we also wish to test this area of the BPT diagram for its merit as a diagnostic tool for composite objects.</p>

										<h3>AGN Effect on Host Morphology</h3>
										</header>										
										<p>It has long been suspected that the energy released by AGN at the centers of massive galaxies are responsible for regulating star-formation. 
										AGN feedback is a way to understand how galaxies have evolved over time, and is an important ingredient in cosmological simulations. </p>
										<p>With data from the JWST Cosmic Evolutions Early Release Science survey (CEERS), we are exploring galaxies at an important time in cosmic history (z = 1-3), when star formation begins its decline until it reaches the rate seen in today’s universe. Galaxies around this time are also more likely to host an active nucleus (see Kocevski et. al. 2017),  thus implying a possible correlation between AGN activity and the decline in star formation during this time.
										<p>Using this novel data, we have selected a subset of potential AGN hosts that may be actively being ‘quenched.’ We are exploring their morphological properties and star-formation histories to determine how the AGN are contributing to the evolution of their hosts, and what implication this has on the possibility of AGN feedback.</p>
