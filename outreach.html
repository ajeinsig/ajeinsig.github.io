											<h3>Outreach</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I begen my interest in outreach during undergrad Dickinson College, where I wrote and performed planetarium shows for schools, girl/boy scout troops, and public observing nights. Our Astronomy club hosted a number of themed events throughout the year, and each was a huge hit with the town, helping the college connect to the Carlisle community.</p>
										<p>Our group also organized off-campus experiences, such as volunteering opportunities and trips to dark sky parks. Both of these were open to any student enrolled at the college who were even remotely interested in learning more about astronomy.
										<p>The pandemic halted most of my outreach opportunities at Colby. At Wesleyan, I was excited to help the Astro department slowly begin to open the doors to the public again post-pandemic. Through our Astronomy Pedagogy course, I learned how to best reach both children and adults and get them interested in astronomy. I also returned to my roots of hosting planetarium shows - Wes Astro has a portable digital planetarium, which I and other students took to schools and libraries to bring an interactive, planet-hopping show to members of our community.</p>
										<p>I was also involved in observing-related outreach at Dickinson and Wes. One of my favorite opportunities was using Wesleyan's 20" Alvan Clarke Great Refractor to teach folks about the objects in the night sky, and share some histroy about the Van Vleck Observatory itself. If you happen to be reading this and near the Middletown CT area, Wesleyan has begun hosting open nights <i>every week!</i> They are during the semesters on Wednesdays, rain or shine. <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/astro/events/index.html">All info is on the Wes Astro website.</a></p>
										<p>Finally, I was extremely proud to help organize Wesleyan's first annual Star-Gay-Zing LGBTQ outreach event this fall as an alumnus. Our awesome team is pictured below. <a href="https://ebar.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2023/10/19/1st-annual-vvo-star-gayzing-event/">Read more about the event here!</a></p>

											<h3>Teaching</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Right out of undergrad, I was presented with the incredible opportunity to teach physics and astronomy labs at Colby College as a member of their department. This was formative for me, and I know that I want to continue working in academia largely due to this experience. This also coencided with Spring and Fall 2020 semesters. Learning how to be an excellent instructor during this time was deifnitely a challenge, but I feel I am better because of it. </p>
										<p>The experience I gained at Colby continued into my work as a TA during my Master's degree. I endeavor to bring compassion, encouragement, and understanding whenever I need to help a student - I always strive to help them leave with more confidence than when they arrived.</p>
